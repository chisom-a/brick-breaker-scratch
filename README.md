# Development History #
I originally made this program around May 2021 to become familiar with Scratch. After making a Brick Breaker-like game in Code.org, I wanted to see what it would be like to develop the same game using a beginner tool made for desktops, unlike Code.org which was more designed for mobile devices, so I settled on Scratch. I used Scratux (https://github.com/scratux/scratux/releases) to create the Scratch project. During development, I used the original Code.org version I made as a reference for this version. I also used another program to compile the project into a single HTML file so people could try it out using a web browser. The publishment of this program is for those interested in the personal projects I developed over the years.
